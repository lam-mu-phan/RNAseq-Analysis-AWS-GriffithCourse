## This GitHub repository has 2 purposes:
1. Record what I've learned, step-by-step how I do the analysis for my future self to look back.
2. Help other self-learners like me who don't have the chance to attend the course in-person.

We'll be learning not only tools for bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analysis but also cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
The course website is: https://rnabio.org/

## This GitHub reposistory contains:
1. Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) detailing my explanantion, my code (from this course but also alternative code learned from ChatGPT and other courses) and outputs.
2. A better guideline on how to log into course compute (EC2 instance) for self-learners like me who don't have the chance to attend the course in-person.
3. Bonus: How to install Jupyter Notebook to your instance so you can record your progress as you're running the analysis like I did. I learned this from ChatGPT, so thanks, ChatGPT!

## How to use:
1. Follow the course's instruction: https://rnabio.org/course/
2. If you're curious if your output looks like mine or learn from me some more efficient/interesting ways to execute some commands, look at my Jupyter Notebook files, eg "Module01_annotations_indexing.ipynb". I name my .ipynb files accordingly to the course. To view .ipynb file, click on it while you're on this GitHub page, or install Jupyter Notebook to your EC2 instance (instrution can be found in EC2-Jupyter.txt file). 

Contact me at lam.mu.phan@gmail.com should you have any questions regarding my codes.
